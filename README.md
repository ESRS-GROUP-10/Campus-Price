A student E-commerce web application
We aim to develop a student-to-student e-commerce platform. This platform will enable students within academic institutions to buy and sell items among themselves. Initially, the platform will be developed as a web application, with the potential to create future mobile applications to enhance accessibility and reach.
The primary goal of this platform is to simplify and facilitate transactions between students, providing a dedicated space for them to engage in buying and selling activities. By focusing on the needs specific to student communities, the platform aims to become a practical tool for peer-to-peer commerce within educational settings.
Our target audience includes current students only. These students will be interested in purchasing textbooks, clothing and supplies. An e-commerce web app will make it easier for students to buy, sell, and find necessary items. Our target audience will be geographically limited to the UK.
